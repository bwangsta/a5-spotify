Gestures:
Two Open Hands = Stop Detection
    - Open hand usually signals stop so we decided that it would stop our detection video.
Swipe Right = Go Back A Page
    - Similar to how going back works on a mobile device, we decided on swiping right to go back.
Swipe Left = Go Forward A Page
    - Similar to how going forward works on a mobile device, we decided on swiping left to go forward.
Point = Go To The First Track Of The Artist Or First Track Of The Album
    - Pointing uses a single finger and a single finger can be interpreted as the number one, so 
      we decided that pointing will take the user to the first track of the artist or first track of 
      the album.
Pinch = Go To Home Page
    - Home in American Sign Language is a pinching gesture from the cheek to the ear, so that is why
      we decided that pinching would take the user to the home page.
Closed Hand = Login
    - Because closed hand is an easy gesture to make and detect and login is essential for the web app,
      we decided that such an simple gesture would be used to login.
Two Closed Hands = Go To Spotify Pages
    - Out of all the remaining gestures that we had, this gesture was the simplest and most consistent
      way to be detected.
